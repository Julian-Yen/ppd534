# Assignments

See the schedule in the syllabus for all assignment due dates. Submissions are due by 23:59 on their due date.

You will be graded on your adherence to *all* the instructions. For some assignments, this includes specific file naming. For others, it includes writing short narratives in markdown describing what you did with your code, why, and interpreting what it means in the real world.
