# Course software

You need a laptop for this course, but all the required software is free and open-source. See the modules folder for details on using the course software on JupyterHub.

If you have software problems/trouble down the road, log out of JupyterHub, close all open programs on your computer, restart your computer, then try your task again. If the problem still persists, contact the TA.
